  <p>
    I’m a passionate and driven technology enthusiast with a strong interest in DevOps and Cloud technologies.
    My expertise spans across major cloud platforms including <strong>Azure, GCP, AWS, and Oracle Cloud</strong>,
    and I actively work with modern infrastructure tools like <strong>Kubernetes (K8s), Terraform (TF), Ansible</strong>,
    and GitOps workflows using GitHub.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to my cloud and automation skills, I enjoy scripting with <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Shell</strong>,
    and have hands-on experience with databases such as <strong>MySQL</strong> and <strong>MongoDB</strong>.
    I thrive in environments that encourage learning and experimentation, and I’m constantly upgrading my skills through
    self-driven projects and certifications.
  </p>
  <p>
    My goal is to build scalable, secure, and efficient systems while staying on the cutting edge of technology.
    I love solving complex problems, automating manual tasks, and contributing to innovative projects that push the boundaries
    of what’s possible in cloud and DevOps engineering.
